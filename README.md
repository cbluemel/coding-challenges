# Coding Challenges

As a motivated, often times contract web developer, when I'm looking for a new gig, I am almost always asked to do one or both of two things:
1. Provide code samples
2. Complete coding challenges

Since I am very busy, all of my code that I could demonstrate is proprietary, and that makes sharing extremely difficult. In the past, I have
considered coding challenges to be throw away code, but I am now realizing that these could provide a good sample of my approach to solving
problems through code.

Each coding challenge I am asked to complete will reside in its own folder in this repo and contain a readme to explain the challenge.
